# ISYS 2160 A2

## Instructions

I have used WampServer as the web development environment. This offers a 
platform to create web applications with Apache2 as local server, PHP and 
mySQL. Follow the following steps to run the web applications locally.

1. Install WampServer package at http://www.wampserver.com/en/
2. Navigate and place this directory under C:\wamp\www\. For example: 
   C:\wamp\www\ISYS2160_G6\
3. Access the SQL database at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
4. Create a new database of your choice and run tables.sql on your database
5. The default database name is called products_db. If you have another name for your database, configure `db_config.php` and change the database name 
6. Make sure you have WampServer running, any PHP or HTML files in this folder 
   can be accessed at http://localhost/ISYS2160_G6/
